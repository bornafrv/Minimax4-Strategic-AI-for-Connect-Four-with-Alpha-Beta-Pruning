## ♟️ Key Features

### 🧠 Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Simulates all possible future moves up to a depth limit
- Prunes irrelevant branches to enhance computational efficiency
- Provides intelligent decision-making in real-time

### 🎯 Heuristic Evaluation Function
- Scores each game state based on:
  - Center control
  - Connected sequences of tokens
  - Threat detection and countermeasures

### 🖥️ Visual Gameplay (with Pygame)
- Interactive board with colored tokens
- Real-time player vs AI gameplay
- Highlights winning sequences
